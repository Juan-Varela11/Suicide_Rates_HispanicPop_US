# Suicide Death Rates within the US Hispanic & Latino Communities, 1985 - 2023

## Motivation & Goals
The New York Times has published numerous articles on the rise of mental health symptoms being observed in the younger generations in the United States [1][2][7], as well as higher suicide death rates reported[3][4]. Coming from a Hispanic background, I wish to observe how mental health distress may be affecting the Hispanic & Latino groups within the U.S. by analyzing data on the suicide death rate in these communities. Factors such as poverty, language barriers, and lack of bilingual mental health resources have been cited as a rise in Latino suicide deaths over the years, as well as heightened worry about behavioral healths concerns in the demographic [5][6]. Data is collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Office of Minority Health (OMH). Visualizations of suicide trends within the different demographics, genders, and age brackets are constructed.<br>

##  Conclusions<br>
Observed a higher rate of suicide deaths in the male Hispanic & Latino community when compared to the female population. A higher rate of suicide deaths is present in people younger than 65 within the female population as of 2018, while men see an increasing rate of comparable magnitude across all age brackets except at 65 years or above at which the rate has plateaued. Rates of suicide deaths seeminly experienced a slump from approximately 2000 to 2010, before seeing an increase. <br>

Data for 2022 and 2023 is provisional and extracted from CDC Wonder. Provisional data is subject to change until the data are reconciled and verified with the state and territorial data providers.<br>

Will visualize and compare these trends to comparable ones for different races (White, Black or African American, Asian or Pacific Islanders, American Indian or Alaskan Native). These different race groupings defined by the CDC. <br>
